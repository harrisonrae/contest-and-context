        <div class="text-box">"Fugitivity bears the trace of the law."</div>


        <div class="text-box">
            I never considered that the term fugitive isn’t static. A persons fugitivity depends upon the hierarchies and systems of power they exist under. A fugitive may flee from somewhere, to a place with different laws and values, becoming a refugee. It’s something I’ve thought about recently after reading Andrew Brooks review of Saidiya Hartman’. In his review of Hartman’s Wayward Lives, Brooks defines fugitivity as an attempt to resist the constraints imposed by dominant systems of power. The fugitive attempts to live freely under oppressive conditions through methods of evasion.

        <div class="text-box">A talk by Paul Soulellis titled publishing as practice as resistance states something very clearly that I had not yet come close to articulating: “I’m looking more and more towards critical writing, not visual art, for clues about how to deal with crisis, particularly around failure and futurity.“ Outside of Andrew Brooks, the critical writing I’ve read recently seems more appropriate for negotiating with government and institutional surveillance then I may have realised.

            Jack Halberstam introduced me to the idea of resisting legibility. What does its resistance mean if legibility is defined as “quality clear enough to be read”?  To explicate the parameters of this discussion I searched for the definition of illegible: “impossible or near impossible to read”.  However in that same talk by Paul Soulellis he had an optimistic understanding of Illegibility. His understanding is that it does not result in the impossibility of a reading or an inability to solicit any meaning. Instead Paul Soulellis spoke of illegibility as being able to generate a variety of valid readings and interpretations.

            James C. Scott, in Seeing Like a State, explores how states attempt to make societies legible for the purposes of control.
            
            I see resisting legibility through everyday actions as a gesture of refusal, a rejection of institutional desire to define myself for the imposition of regulation. A strategy to avoid being easily categorised and controlled by dominant systems of power. A refusal of prerequisite definitions is a denial of the legitimacy of laws and regulations; does this mean that in engaging with illegibility that I am engaging with a form of fugitivity?

            September 21, an alternative milk brand advertises their brand with pasteups, the images are mugshots, with text stating “oat dealer”. There is something so surface-level about adopting a criminal-aesthetic to advertise oat milk. I continue walking, I’m on my high horse in Marrickville, and I hear a friend say my name. Her boyfriend posted the Cao Fei short film on his blog refusal. Together they are hosting a monthly workshop of letter writing to people in correction centres. Writing to people that have left boundaries of law and order, apprehended and now legible as a numeric prisoner ID. In participating I consider the status of my legibility and use an alias. I’m confronted with reality, and the idea that similarly to an alternative milk brand I am also using an aesthetic of fugitivity for my own purpose.

            Earlier this year at a gallery in Paddington I presented a new sculptural work. The work was a cairn of sandstone for the hundred-and-fifty-or-so convicts that had to work on Busby’s Bore, mirroring a cairn of rocks in Centennial Park erected for Busby. The work continued themes I had worked with previously: the histories of Sydney, particularly the histories left out of the mythology crafted by local government. The cairn in the gallery was made up of found-sandstone I had come across while tracing the map of Busby’s Bore from Paddington to the City.  The cairn of rocks stood as a refusal of the attempts to valorise John Busby, creating a counter-myth to contradict the narrative that is naturalised through naming cafes and suburbs after Busby. With the fragments of archival materials I could find about the workers/convicts/slaves I was interested in using Saidiya Hartman’s process to use the gaps of the fragmented archive to generate critical fabulations.

            Recently a friend's blog posted a Cao Fei short film under a board named refusal. With only 153 seconds the films excerpt depicts parallel realities, exploring different relationships of humanity and freedom through a dialogue between a prisoner and an architect. The pair engage in ideas of freedom as well as imprisonment both visible and invisible. Crucially, the crux of this film relies on existentialism as a tool for self redemption. Below the video – hosted on Cao Fei’s web page – features text related to the artist's films: “For Hegel, the pursuit of freedom is human nature.”  The artist's website continues, stating that the video Prison Architect “is the artist’s attempt at reconciliation with the world and human nature.” Naively, I imagine how I would reconcile the world and human nature, thinking the answer was in range.

            I’ve used aliases before. Vulnerable artistic projects, suspicious characters and coffee orders are a few reasons I have used an alias. In these instances I do not see these as being processes for avoiding dominant powers, and evading systems of control. Refusing legibility, becoming illegible to systems of power is a tactic to for marginalised communities to be invisible, protecting themselves from oppressive systems of power. In my position of privilege, I’m not protecting myself. On the bus home while thinking this through I reason to myself that my resistance of legibility is a small refusal to be complicit in the same system as the one that I see manifests state sanctioned violence and racism.
