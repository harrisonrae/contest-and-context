            I never considered that the term fugitive isn’t static. 
            Fugitivity depends upon hierarchies and systems of power that one exists under. 
            A fugitive may flee from one place, becoming a refugee in another.

            A talk by the artist and educator Paul Soulellis titled "publishing as practice as resistance" articulates a thought that I had been approaching but not yet arrived at.
            He said: "I'm looking more and more towards critical writing, not visual art, for clues about how to deal with crisis, particularly around failure and futurity."
            I find truth in this; the writing I've read recently seems more appropriate for negotiating with systems of power.

                Jack Halberstam introduced me to the idea of 'resisting legibility'. 
            With my finger tracing the screen left to right I read the definition of legibility as "quality clear enough to be read". 
            What does it mean to resist this?
        </p>
        <p> 
            I wondered about the definition of illegible, and whether it would help to explicate the parameters of this discussion.
            The search-engine stated its definition as "impossible or near impossible to read". 
        </p>
            Paul Soulellis, an academic writing on the resistance in publishing has a more optimistic understanding of illegibility and resisting legibility.
            Soulellis' understanding is that illegibility does not result in the impossibility of a reading or an inability to solicit any meaning.
            Instead Soulellis spoke of illegibility as being able to generate a variety of valid readings and interpretations.
            'Resisting legibility' is therefore resisting a singular reading of identity. 
            A refusal to be blunted by sharp lines of definition.

            James C. Scott, in 'Seeing Like a State', explores how states attempt to make societies legible for the purposes of control.
            The legibility of a society in turn allows the state to act in ways to prevent and counter the actions taken by members of society which do not figure into state objectives.
            'Resisting legibility' and refusing the state this level of control is important to maintain agency and autonomy. 
            Using everyday actions as opportunites for small gestures of refusal, I can make attempts at refusing state and institutional desires to define myself for the imposition of their regulations. 
            It's a strategy to avoid being easily categorised and controlled by dominant systems of power. 
           <p></p> A refusal of prerequisite definitions is a denial of the legitimacy of laws and regulations; 
            does this mean that in engaging with illegibility that I am engaging with a form of fugitivity?

            <p> September 21st, an alternative milk company advertises their brand with pasteups. The images are mugshots; the text states “oat dealer”...
                There is something so surface-level about adopting this fugitive-aesthetic to advertise oat milk. To perform alterity.
    (this isn't what Fred Moten was talking about when he says fugitive aesthetics). 
            </p> 
                Walking toward Marrickville Road I hear a friend say my name.
                Her boyfriend posted a Cao Fei short film on his blog 'refusal'.
                Together they are hosting a monthly workshop of letter writing to people in Correctional Centres.
                I'm confronted with the reality of how I've adopted a fugitive-aesthetic:
                I'm writing about fugitivity with limited engagement. I've written about resisting power structures.
                I have listened to stories about Bushrangers in Tassie; becoming fugitives from circumstance.
                My Instagram feed updates me on the current frontline of colonisation, where families in Palestine and Southern Lebanon are forced to leave their homes, or face risk of becoming fugitives if they refuse.
                I haven't given much thought to people in circumstances more similar to my time and place.
                People who had similarities, who have been apprehended and are now legible to the State as a numeric prisoner ID.
                In participating in this workshop, I consider my own legibility; how does the State read me?
                I'm not worth the states time; I use an alias anyway. 
                I'm no longer sure how to differentiate how an oat milk brand and I use fugitivity.

            2021: Next to a car park in Parra I watched Snoee Badman — the first Australian to release an EP from inside a maximum-security prison. 
            I remember him wearing all white and with his face covered. It was a celebration of someone defiantly creative, resisting the systems silencing. 
Fred Moten wrote in a paper on fugitive aesthetics about the potential for art to refuse commodification and resist the logics of capital and coloniality.
            Releasing a tape from behind bars felt like it resonated with parts of what Moten wrote, as well as a "fuck you" to the gaol system. I was eager to join in this, in this safe kind of contradictory implicit and explicit way in the Erby Street Car Park. 
            Connected together in some kind of moment of alterity, as performer and listener.

                On the 426 up Marrickville Road the lane heading towards Sydenham Station is closed. 
            Cops and paramedics are outside Guzman y Gomez and the bus continues toward Dulwich Hill. </p>
            Same bus next day someone plays the news loudly from their phone. 
            I hear that the police operation was because around 7:40pm last night-a Monday night-a man was killed in front of his family having dinner at GYG. 
            The man who allegedly stabbed him was Snoee Badman.

            Recently under a blog titled 'refusal', my friend posted a Cao Fei short film. 
           With only 153 seconds, the films excerpt depicts parallel realites and explores relationships of humanity and freedom through a dialogue between a prisoner and architect.
           In the excerpt, we see the pair engaging in ideas of visible and invisible imprisonment.
        </p>
           In a block of text beneath the video I initially highlighted two things. 
           <p>
           First: "For Hegel, the pursuit of freedom is human nature." 
        The second is an attempt to understand the videos content, suggesting that the video is the artists attempts at "reconciliation with the world and human nature."
             </p>
         <p>  Naively, I imagine how I would reconcile the world and human nature, thinking the answer was in range.
           I understand from the text I'd highlighted that if human nature is the pursuit of freedom, then the world is the force that prevents it.

            Fugitivity is something I've considered a lot after reading Andrew Brooks review of 'Wayward Lives'.
            In reviewing Hartman, Brooks defines fugitivity for the reader as an attempt to resist the constraints imposed by dominant systems of power.
            The fugitive attempts to live freely under oppressive conditions through methods of evasion.

        <div class="text-box">
            Last year I wrote about primitive hypertext as a methodology for 'creative resistance'.
            In writing and conceiving of how to link hypertext to a process or methodology I leaned upon Michel De Certeau and his 1980 book 'The Practice of Everyday Life'
        In this book de Certeau writes broadly about how our bodies navigate networks and spaces.
        More specifically, he discusses how economic and social forces implemented by systems of power affect our ability to navigate the world.
        De Certeau calls the combination of these forces the 'grid of discipline.'
        These economic and social forces enable institutions to maintain the status quo and perpetuate the functionalist reality we exist within.
        Self expression is stifled in the necessity to make ends meet and interests are given less value than they deserve in a capitalist structure.
        I wrote about using primitive hypertext as a means to be unbound and infinite. To make meaning in whichever way makes sense for me and to be guided by that.
